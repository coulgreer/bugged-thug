# Bugged Thug

A simple card game made during [Game Off 2021](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021), where the secret theme was BUG.

This game interprets the theme as a BUG planted on a thug turned informant. Collecting information from the informants former allies will not be easy. They must do so casually while avoiding suspicion as too much prying will reveal the informants motives, and everyone knows a snitch is never appreciated in the underground world.
